/**
 * A see-through wall standing on every border between an unlocked chunk and a locked
 * one, so it's obvious in the game world where you can and can't go. It fades from
 * the configured colour at the ground to clear at the top.
 *
 * Only border edges are drawn (a few hundred short segments near the player), not
 * every tile, so it stays cheap; per-tile shading was too slow in Java2D.
 *
 * Unlocking a chunk opens its wall as a wave: starting nearest the player, each
 * section surges up and then drops away, the wave running outwards along the wall in
 * both directions until it's gone. If the unlock dealt reveal cards, the wall waits
 * until every card has been flipped and cleared off the screen, then opens.
 *
 * The top edge always ripples like flames, and the wall flares up taller and brighter
 * as the player walks up to it.
